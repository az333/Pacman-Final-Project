# Pacman-Final-Project

Development Log:

June 7: Finished maze (grid and image overlay) /n
June 10: Implemented Pacman /n
June 12: Implemented ghost control

Bugs:
- Sometimes your exit will not appear directly over a tile.

Features:
- Ghosts that are user controlled
- Pacman which is directed by Lee's algorithm (finds the shortest path (BFS) between points)
- Dots to be eaten by Pacman

How to Use:
- All files are in the folder named AntiPacman so that's where you should pull.
- The game starts right away once you press the play button!
- Pacman moves of his own accord, trying to eat of the dots and then reaching the exit. If he does eat of the dots and reaches the exit, then the computer wins.
- The ghosts are operated by you! You switch between them, using 1 = red, 2 = pink, 3 = orange, 4 = blue (The white dot is the exit)
- To win you must eat Pacman!
