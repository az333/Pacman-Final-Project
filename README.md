Bugs:
TBA

Features:
- Pacman that is user controlled
- Ghosts with different algorithms
- Score counter
- Dots to be eaten, as well as energizers (the big dots) and fruits in order to gain points

How to Use:
- All files are in the folder named PACMAN so that's where you should pull.
- The game starts right away once you press the play button!
- All the basic rules of Pacman apply:
  - Use arrow keys to navigate Pacman
  - Eat as many dots as possible to gain points and try to avoid the ghosts
  - If you eat a big dot (aka an energizer) you can put the ghosts in scatter mode, which means you can eat the ghosts and send them back to home (temporarily)
  - Eating fruit will also give you bonus points.
  - If a ghost reaches you first while its in chase mode (aka the ghosts are all different colors), then you die and lose a life.
  - 3 strikes and you're out -- If you lose all 3 lives you lose!
  - If you want to replay the game you'll need to exit the window and press play again.
